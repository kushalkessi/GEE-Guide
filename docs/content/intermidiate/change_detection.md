# Change Detection
**Change detection** in Google Earth Engine (GEE) is the process of identifying differences in land features over time using satellite imagery. It is widely used to monitor changes in land use/land cover (LULC), urban growth, forest loss, and water body shifts. GEE supports various methods such as index-based change (e.g., NDVI difference), spectral comparison (multi-band distance), single stacked image classification, and post-classification comparison. Among these, **post-classification comparison** is commonly used for LULC change detection, where classified maps from two different dates are compared to identify class transitions. This approach is simple, effective, and visually interpretable, making it ideal for analyzing long-term environmental and developmental changes.
