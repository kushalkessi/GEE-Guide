2. Importance of Satellite Data
Satellite data helps monitor forests, urban areas, floods, fires, and more. It is vital for decision-making, planning, and environmental management.

3. Real-world Applications of GEE
Deforestation tracking
Urban growth analysis
Water body monitoring
Disaster risk mapping

4. GEE for Beginners (No Coding Needed!)
You can use Earth Engine Apps and explore maps without writing a single line of code. This makes GEE accessible to everyone.
